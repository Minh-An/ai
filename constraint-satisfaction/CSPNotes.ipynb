    "\n",
    "Constraint Satisfaction Problems can be framed as a Triple <X, D, C> :\n",
    "\n",
    "- `X` is a set of variables, {X1, …, Xn}.\n",
    "- `D` is a set of domains, {D1, ..., Dn}, one for each variable.\n",
    "- `C` is a set of constraints that specify allowable combinations of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each domain Di consists of a set of allowable values, {v1,...,vk} for variable $X_i$.\n",
    "2. Each constraint Ci consists of a pair `⟨scope, rel⟩`, where `scope` is a tuple of variables that participate in the constraint and `rel` is a relation that defines the values that those variables can take on.\n",
    "3. For example, if X1 and X2 both have the domain `{A,B}`, then the constraint saying the two variables must have different values can be written as *⟨($X_1, X_2$), [(A, B), (B, A)]⟩ or as ⟨($X_1, X_2), X_1 ≠ X_2$⟩*"

    "\n",
    "If we used a standard **depth first search**, then for $n$ variables each with $d$ possible values the branching factor of the resulting tree would be $nd$ at the top level, $(n-1)d$ at the second level, $(n-2)d$ at the next level, and so on. The total branching factor would be $n! d^n$ when there are only $d^n$ possible assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtracking to avoid redundancy\n",
    "Backtracking is identical to depth first search order, but it only evaluates a single assignment order for the variables and it reverts an assignments whenever the current state is inconsistent with any of the problem constraints. Backtracking will typically find a solution= faster than depth first search.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key feature of backtracking search is that the choice of which variable to assign first and the choice of which value to assign can have a big impact on the efficiency of the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "![backtracking](img/backtracking.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aside: Local Search \n",
    "While depth first search and backtracking apply variable assignments one at a time, local search always considers complete assignments -- every variable in the problem is always assigned to a concrete value (compare that to the root node of a dfs tree where none of the variables are assigned).\n",
    "\n",
    "Local search operates by starting with a complete assignment, then modifying one or more of the variable values within some \"local neighborhood\" of the current assignment. \n",
